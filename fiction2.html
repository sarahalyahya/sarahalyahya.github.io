	<h1>What's their Story?</h1>
	<p class="story">We went to camp together, and we both had a liking for this local band who had made it relatively big, so for her birthday, I got two tickets to see them at a homecoming show as a way of asking her out. I put the tickets in her card and wrote some crap about looking forward to taking her.

	As soon as we went there she started questioning me about various things, she started doubting me and there after we developed lots of misunderstanding between us. It was then when i realised that it wasn't working anymore and rather than discussing situations with her i made a quick decision of break up. I still remember that day she was begging me to stay. All she was asking me to not to leave her for she wanted me and just me.

	Our relationship can easily be described as: cold-hearted, lousy, dismal, shocking, ugly, I think it just never would have worked. We tried really hard but it just wasn't meant to be. So we never talked again, and I decided to send her this text through the Unsent Project. I don't know if she'll ever receive it, or read it...I'm not sure I care. </p>
