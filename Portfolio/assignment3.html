            <p>This was definitely the most unfamiliar project for me. I was never tasked with creating something that is predominantly audio-based, and my first instinct was to think of a biographical / oral history approach. However, both my teammates felt like taking on a thriller theme. I initially hesitated because it was new territory. How does one manage to spark a feeling like fear in a viewer? It felt like a difficult task, but my groupmates’ excitement about the subject matter motivated me to go for it.</p>
            <p>We realized that if we wanted to grasp our viewer’s attention, we needed to do more than just tell the story, we need to involve them in piecing a case together. This immediately reminded me of escape room games I used to play on my computer as a child, and this is where the inspiration for our second panel, perhaps the main panel in our audiovisual experience, came from. We picked a rather unexpected story and wanted to allow the user to dig for the plot twist themselves.</p>
            <p>I was mainly responsible for visuals and collecting and editing some of the sounds for this assignment. Somehow, collaging made its way into this assignment too, especially because our main inspiration, online escape room games, use a similar approach with visuals! For the sounds, our main goal was to create something convincing, so we kept editing the sounds and altering them to make sure they are as impactful as possible.</p>
            <p>I’m glad we went for a murder-mystery theme! It is quite unlike what I would usually do and I loved the challenge and the fun that came with it. </p>
